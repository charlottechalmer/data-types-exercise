		* Why does the following output true?

		var a = "false";
		var b = true;

		// "&&" is "and"
		console.log (a && b); //this outputs true because even though "false" reads the word "false", it is not a boolean and rather a string. Any string that is not empty will automatically equate to "true", thus making the statement (a && b) === (true && true) thus === true.
		
		/*
		* Bonus Question: Why does (b && a) log "false"? According to the rules of the && operator, it will return the first expression if it can be converted to false, which in this case, it cannot; otherwise, returns the second expression, "false" as a string rather than the boolean value.
